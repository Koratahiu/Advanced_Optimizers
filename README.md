## 🧠 Core Innovations

This library integrates multiple state-of-the-art optimization techniques validated through extensive research and practical training, with **1-bit compression for optimizer states**:

### **Memory-Efficient Optimization (SMMF-inspired)**
- **Paper**: [SMMF: Square-Matricized Momentum Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08894)
- **Approach**: Uses rank-1 non-negative matrix factorization with reconstruction cycle (factor → reconstruct → update → factor)
- **Innovation**:
  - First moment split into **1-bit sign + absolute value**
  - Final storage: **four factored vectors + one 1-bit sign state**
  - Preserves Adam-like update quality with drastically reduced memory

## 🔍 Feature Deep Dives

### AdEMAMix

- Adds a **slow-decaying second EMA** (`beta3`) that retains gradient memory over tens of thousands of steps.
- Particularly effective for **small batch sizes**, where Adam’s standard first moment is nearly useless.
- **Reference**: [AdaMeM: Memory Efficient Momentum for Adafactor](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fZqMVTz7K5)

#### Tunable Hyperparameters
| Parameter | Default | Tuning Guide |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `beta3` | 0.9999 | • Runs >120k steps: **0.9999**<br>• Runs ≤120k steps: **0.999** |
| `alpha` | 5 | • Reduce to **2–3** if diverging<br>• Increase to strengthen long-term memory |

> ✅ **Pro Tip**: Set `beta1=0` in Adam/Adopt/Prodigy to skip standard EMA entirely and rely solely on AdEMAMix’s slow EMA, ideal for small-batch regimes.

---

### Simplified_AdEMAMix

- Introduced in [Connections between Schedule-Free Optimizers, AdEMAMix, and Accelerated SGD Variants (arXiv:2502.02431)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02431).
- Replaces Adam’s first moment with a **gradient accumulator**, combining the stability of long memory with responsiveness to recent gradients.
- **Key insight**: Classical momentum **does not accelerate** in noisy (small-batch) regimes; this accumulator do.

#### Tunable Hyperparameters
| Parameter | Default | Tuning Guide |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| `beta1` | 0.99 | Controls accumulator memory length:<br>• Small BS: **0.99–0.9999**<br>• Large BS: **0.9** |
| `Grad α` | 100 | Most critical parameter:<br>• Inversely scales with batch size<br>• **100–10** for small BS (≤32)<br>• **1–0.1** for large BS (≥512) |

> ⚠️ **Critical**: Requires **~100x smaller learning rate** than AdamW (e.g., 1e-6 vs 1e-4).
> For `Prodigy_Adv`, set `initial_d` to:
> - **LoRA**: `1e-8`
> - **Full FT**: `1e-10`
> - **Embedding**: `1e-7`

> ⚠️ **Incompatible** with: **Cautious**, **Grams**, **atan2**, and standard gradient clipping.

#### Performance Validation

**Small Batch Training (SDXL, BS=2, 1.8K steps)**
![Training Comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7eff0671-cc59-47fc-8b63-d5205456d649)

- **🟢 Prodigy_Adv** (beta1=0.9, d0=1e-5): Final LR = 2.9e-4
- **🔵 Prodigy_Adv + Simplified_AdEMAMix** (beta1=0.99, α=100, d0=1e-7): Final LR = 5.8e-6

**Results**:
- Faster convergence and higher final performance with Simplified_AdEMAMix
- D-Adaptation automatically compensates for aggressive updates
- Generated samples show **significantly better quality**

---

### atan2

- Replaces `eps` in Adam-family optimizers with a **scale-invariant**, bounded update rule.
- Automatically clips updates to **[-2, 2]**, preventing destabilizing jumps.
- **Highly recommended** for `Adopt_Adv`, which is prone to instability without clipping.

---

### **Kourkoutas-β**

**Kourkoutas-β** introduces a **sunspike-driven, layer-wise adaptive second-moment decay (β₂)** as an optional enhancement for `Adam_Adv`, `Adopt_Adv`, `Prodigy_Adv`, and `Simplified_AdEMAMix`.

Instead of using a fixed β₂ (e.g., 0.999 or 0.95), it **dynamically modulates β₂ per layer** based on a bounded *sunspike ratio*:

- **During gradient bursts** → β₂ ↓ toward `Lower β₂` → faster reaction
- **During calm phases** → β₂ ↑ toward `The Selected β₂` → stronger smoothing

This is especially effective for **noisy training, small batch sizes, and high learning rates**, where gradient norms shift abruptly due to noise or aggressive LR schedules.

#### Pros/Cons

| **Category** | **Details** |
|--------------|-------------|
| ✅ **Pros** | • **Layer-wise adaptation** blends benefits of high β₂ (strong smoothing) and low β₂ (fast reaction).<br>• **Robust to sudden loss landscape shifts**, reacts quickly during gradient bursts, smooths during calm phases.<br>• **High tolerance to aggressive learning rates**. |
| ⚠️ **Cons** | • **Potentially unstable at the start of training** due to unreliable early gradient norms; mitigated by using `K-β Warmup Steps`. |

> 💡 **Best Practice**: Set `K_warmup_steps` equal to your standard LR warmup steps. During warmup, the optimizer uses the static `beta2`; adaptation begins only after warmup ends.

> 🔍 **Debugging Aid**: Enable `K_Logging` to monitor (min, max, mean) of dynamic β₂ values across layers every *N* steps.

#### 📊 Performance Validation

**ADAMW_ADV - full SDXL finetuning (aggressive LR: 3e-5) (BS=4, 2.5K steps)**

- 🟣 Fixed `beta2=0.999`
- 🟠 Auto K-beta

**Observations:**
- K-beta is clearly better and more robust/stable for high LRs.

  - beta2: 0.999
  - kourkoutas_beta: True   # For Kourkoutas-β
  - K-β Warmup Steps: 50    # Or 100, 200, depending on your run
  - Simplified_AdEMAMix: True
  - Grad α: 100

      • Full fine-tune: 1e-10
      • Embedding: 1e-7
  - d_coef: 1
  - factored: False  # Can be true or false, quality should not degrade due to Simplified_AdEMAMix’s high tolerance to 1-bit factorization.
```

> ✅ **Why it works**:
> - `Kourkoutas-β` handles beta2 values
> - `Simplified_AdEMAMix` ensures responsiveness in small-batch noise
> - `OrthoGrad` prevents overfitting without weight decay
